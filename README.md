# Research-internship-SHARE-Study
This is how I got data from the SHARE Study for my internship, keeping the only one I needed, dealing with missings values and stuff.

I did a research internship on the following topic : "Analysis of epidemiological data : the relationship between socioeconomic status, risk behaviors and cancer incidence". I had to learn from scratch how to manipulate this type of data, how to transform them etc. The SHARE Study is a huge database on european individuals. More information at : http://www.share-project.org/home0.html

Here I show what I did for it. It tooks me long time and lot of mistakes in order to get what I wanted, but I have learned a lot on how to deal with probably most of the common problems in data science. The analysis and statistics were probably the things that took me the less time compared to all the processus. I am pretty sur that my code can be a lot simpler, but we all start from somewhere. Hope you enjoy and find it interesting (I will probably soon post the results of this internship for the ones who are interested in).
