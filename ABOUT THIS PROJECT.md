# Research internship SHARE Study
I am doing analysis of epidemiological data from the SHARE Study. My subject is "Analysis of epidemiological data : relationship between socioeconomic status, risk behaviors and cancer incidence". So far I still need to do all the statistical analysis, but I think it will be faster than getting all the data and transform them. I will put the code I used for the analysis as soon as I finish and clean it up.
